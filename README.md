# PasswordEncrypter
A password hasher using the hashlib module in Python.

NOTE: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR SOME OF THE LIBRARIES IMPORTED IN THIS PROGRAM
MAY NOT IMPORT PROPERLY ON DIFFERENT COMPILERS/INTERPRETERS. THIS MAY CAUSE ERRORS
WHEN RUNNING THE CODE OR FLAWS.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PROPER IDE SUCH AS VISUAL STUDIO CODE OR PYCHARM,
PROGRAMIZ HAS A GOOD ONLINE PYTHON COMPILER THAT THIS WORKS WELL ON. 
(HOWEVER THE GETPASS LIBRARY DOES NOT IMPORT PROPERLY)

FOR ANY QUESTIONS CONTACT ME AT jirachi22@proton.me

THANK YOU !
